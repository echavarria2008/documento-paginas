     simple priciples to build peace in your community
     <br><br>
     if you switch on the news, open the newspaper or click onto a popular news website, 
     there´s always news about a terrorist attak, war, ongoin conflict and a general 
     lack of people. in an increasingly globalised worl, we should understand
     each other better, stand ever more united and strive for peace. sadly, the 
     truth is quite the opposite. there´s conflict in israel/ palestine, kashmir, iraq,
     afghanistan, siria, all over the world in fact... as individuals and citizens,
     how do we deal with this? how does this relate to us? how can we make positive 
     changes to enable us to live in peace 
<br><br>
rule1: treat others the way you wish to be treated:
the good old golden rule says it all: empathy, tolerance and peace. this 
principle teaches you to love yourself and love others. it spans cultures
and is a universal age old concept which can't fail¡!¡
<br><br>
rule2: listen to hear what others have to say, not to speak:
engage in dialogue an open mind and the real will to listen to others. only
then will you be able to understand each other and build bridges. change cannot 
happen and peace cannot be established if people are unable to communicate
with others; to listen to their experiences and views and show empathy, understanding
and compassion
<br><br>
rule3: accept difference of opinion:
we all have different opinions and we may not all agree on the same things.
building compromise and mutual understanding is incredibly important. sometimes
we simply need to agree to disagree and recognise that there are different
beliesfs and forms of expression other than our own
<br><br>
rule4: do not fight violence with violence: 
violence is never the answer. peace can only be brought through free will,
dialogue, empathy and forgiveness. do not stoop to same level as someone 
who is violent and therefore continue the vicious cyde this does not
change anything
<br><br>
rule5: accept that identity is fluid: any one person can have multiple aspects
to their identity. identity comprises many elements such as nationality, 
cultural-linguistic origin, age and religious beliefs. identity can and does change,
taking on many new forms and means of personal expression as we learn new 
lenguages, move home, adopt new beliefs,marry into a different tradition 
and experience life! do not put people into a box.avoid categorising people 
according to an us vs. them narrative and remember: we are all singular 
individuals with unique experiences. such approaches and narratives are 
highly divisive and unproductive
<br><br>
rule6: avoid stereotypes: take people for the individuals they are. avoid 
misconceptions, stereotypes and toxic narratives and get to know a person 
instead. this will avoid offence, misunderstandings and ultimately help
you to create a real bond with others based on true undersatanding, empathy 
and trust. after all, no one likes to be judged-especially from the outsid
<br><br>
rule7: aproach the media with skepticism: don't just believe everything 
you see on the tv, in the newspapers or no the internet. think objetively
for yourself. get to know the people and facts behind any story and don't 
fall for media scapegoting. stand united 
<br><br>
rule8: be careful of the language you use: you choice of language, alongside tone of 
voice and intonation all convey a message. make sure that message is intonation 
all convey a message. make sure that that message is positive. be mindful
of the lenguage you use, avoiding anything with misogynistic, racist, islamophobic
homofobic or antisemitic overtones. do not underestimate the power of 
language for better or for worse! and remember, it's not always wath you say, it's 
how you say
